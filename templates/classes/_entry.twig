                  our favorite fall planted vegetable, garlic! Explore Rachel’s
                  home garden that combines fruit trees and raised beds with an
                  extraordinary collection of drought tolerant ornamentals and
                  celebrate the harvest with other plant nerds.

                  You'll leave with a sampler of cover crop seeds and the
                  knowledge of how to use them!

                  This class will be held outside. Please dress appropriately.
                  If it does rain, we will meet inside and make forays out to
                  the garden for demonstrations.

                <p>
                  Jessica Wood, founder of Backyard University, got a community
                  garden plot in 2009 and took some vegetable gardening classes
                  at a local independent garden center while on leave from
                  college. Today, she's a full fledged horticultural
                  professional who works at Iseli, a wholesale specialty conifer
                  and Japanese maple nursery in Boring, OR, and earned a
                  landscape design degree. She loves to teach and share her
                  passion for growing her own food and her appreciation for the
                  wonder that plants and natural ecosystems never cease to
                  inspire. She believes that nurturing a connection with plants
                  grounds us within ourselves and empowers us to cultivate
                  meaningful community relationships and resources. She still
                  calls her community garden plot home and in her free time,
                  you'll find her weeding cucumbers and harvesting strawflowers.

                  Rachel Lindsay knows the botanical name of that one cool
                  flower that you can't remember and she can tell you how to
                  grow it too. And she can tell you how to raise chickens, prune
                  fruit trees, keep bees, tame feral cats, sew, can, code,
                  create a website, or knit socks. This maker and gardener tends
                  a garden bursting with every kind of collector's plant but
                  she's also traveled all over the world. No one waters less in
                  summer or grows sweeter mulberries. Someday, she and her
                  partner hope to move to the San Juan Islands, where they will
                  continue keeping cats, collecting sewing machines, and of
                  course, gardening.
