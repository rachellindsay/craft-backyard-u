              Learn how to winterize your vegetable garden using green manure,
              composing techniques, and soil conditioners. Take home cover crop
              seeds! <span>(more info...)</span>

                After summer is over and the last tomatoes have been harvested,
                it's time to put your vegetable garden to bed for the winter.
                Properly preparing your beds now lays the foundation for ease
                and abundance next spring. Join co-teachers Rachel and Jessica
                to discuss creative composting methods, pH amendment, and using
                cover crops to suppress weeds and improve the health and
                structure of your soil. You’ll learn how to choose the ideal
                cover crops for your beds based on their unique nutrient needs
                and be able to incorporate them into your yearly crop rotation
                plan. We will also talk about our favorite fall planted
                vegetable, garlic! Explore Rachel’s home garden that combines
                fruit trees and raised beds with an extraordinary collection of
                drought tolerant ornamentals and celebrate the harvest with
                other plant nerds.
                <br>
                <br>
                You'll leave with a sampler of cover crop seeds and the
                knowledge of how to use them!

                Start a riot of diversity with your own handmade native
                wildflower seed bombs!! Have you been plotting to reestablish
                wildlife habitat in the city? Do you have the itch to bring back
                native flora to abandoned spaces? Come join us for a workshop
                where we can team up to equip ourselves with radical tools for
                regenerating urban biodiversity.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this class, we will talk about wildflower ecology and
                demonstrate how to create your own wildflower filled seed bombs,
                with "guerrilla habitat restoration" in mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                All resources will be provided. We will provide empty egg
                cartons for seed ball storage &amp; drying, but please bring your
                own empty egg cartons if you have any.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once dried, they are ready for "sowing," or they make a great
                gift that keeps on giving!
                <br>
                <br>
                Included with the class: Clay, worm castings, and native
